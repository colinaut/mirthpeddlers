										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So Colin Fahrion and I got married this Saturday in a SURPRISE LARP wedding. No one knew what was happening. We went as far as to register our friend as a minister in the Universal Life Church! It was incredible. I&#8217;ve never been one who dreams of weddings, but by doing something so silly I ended up with my dream wedding!</p>
<p>We had weird family dynamics, totally out of control flower children, mad libs vows, readings from random books (including a section of Skinny Legs and All which starts, &#8220;JEZEBEL&#8221;) and last but not least the ring bearer took off his pants&#8230; It was basically a giant ridiculous shit show! I was so nervous beforehand that things would go wrong, I was almost in tears! As soon as we started walking down the aisle and I saw everyone jumping and cheering in a cloud of bubbles and paper flower petals I started smiling and laughed the entire ceremony.</p>
<p>To get a sampling of the characters and the ridiculous goings on at our wedding check out:</p>

</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m grateful to all my friends who are really, really good sports! I realize I&#8217;m probably setting myself up for retribution from some people but that is A-ok <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2>Get your own set of Wedding, the LARP cards!</h2>
<p>We have turned Wedding, the LARP into an actual published game! In order for it to work as a published game we created a new illustration,Â changed a few of the characters, added cards for the betrothed, and revamped the cards so that they are degendered so you can have a straight wedding, a gay wedding, or whatever floats your boat!</p>
<p>You can download the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wedding-the-larp-cards-print-and-play.pdf">Wedding, the LARP Print &amp; Play pdf</a> for FREEÂ or buy your own deck of <a href="https://www.drivethrucards.com/product/140530/Wedding-The-LARP">Wedding, The LARP cards from DriveThruCards</a>!</p>
<p>We are also open to custom decks with your photo or illustration on them â€” if this interests you please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@mirthpeddlers.com">info@mirthpeddlers.com</a></p>
