										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the ridiculous surprise debut of &#8220;Wedding, the LARP&#8221; at our <a href="/2014/12/a-surprise-larp-wedding/">surprise LARP wedding</a>, we wanted to create it as a published game!</p>
<p>To transform it to a publish game I created a new card back of two doves (pigeons) in love. We also went through the cards and depersonalized some of the personas and most importantly we degendered all the cards so that it works for any wedding gay or straight or whatever wedding you&#8217;d like to have. WeÂ added several Betrothed cards to choose from so that even the wedding couple can be randomized!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So Colin Fahrion and I got married this Saturday in a SURPRISE LARP wedding. No one knew what was happening. We went as far as to register our friend as a minister in the Universal Life Church! It was incredible. I&#8217;ve never been one who dreams of weddings, but by doing something so silly I ended up with my dream wedding!</p>
<p>We had weird family dynamics, totally out of control flower children, mad libs vows, readings from random books (including a section of Skinny Legs and All which starts, &#8220;JEZEBEL&#8221;) and last but not least the ring bearer took off his pants&#8230; It was basically a giant ridiculous shit show! I was so nervous beforehand that things would go wrong, I was almost in tears! As soon as we started walking down the aisle and I saw everyone jumping and cheering in a cloud of bubbles and paper flower petals I started smiling and laughed the entire ceremony.</p>
<p>To get a sampling of the characters and the ridiculous goings on at our wedding check out:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m grateful to all my friends who are really, really good sports! I realize I&#8217;m probably setting myself up for retribution from some people but that is A-ok <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2>Get your own set of Wedding, the LARP cards!</h2>
<p>We have turned Wedding, the LARP into an actual published game! In order for it to work as a published game we created a new illustration,Â changed a few of the characters, added cards for the betrothed, and revamped the cards so that they are degendered so you can have a straight wedding, a gay wedding, or whatever floats your boat!</p>
<p>You can download the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wedding-the-larp-cards-print-and-play.pdf">Wedding, the LARP Print &amp; Play pdf</a> for FREEÂ or buy your own deck of <a href="https://www.drivethrucards.com/product/140530/Wedding-The-LARP">Wedding, The LARP cards from DriveThruCards</a>!</p>
